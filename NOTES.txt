============================ STEPS FOR CREATING DOCKER IMAGE USING DOCKERFILE AND RUN CONTAINER
- Change packaging of the application to .jar in pom.xml
- Change final jar  name of the application in build in pom.xml
- Create docker file without any extension.
- You must build your application first using maven , so that it has .jar file in its target folder:
		>> docker build -t r15priyanshu/expensemate-backend:latest .
- You can now create containers from the image:
		>> docker run --name expensemate-backend-instance -d -e MONGODB_URI=mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/expensemate -e OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23likzQSOkVxLoF9Ql -e OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=2a2e11ce9b9a3da23a690222879acaab3e01b034 -p 8080:8080 r15priyanshu/expensemate

============================ STEPS FOR CREATING DOCKER IMAGE USING BUILD PACKS AND RUN CONTAINER
- Change packaging of the application to .jar in pom.xml
- Just add image name, tag name in "Spring Boot Maven Plugin" in pom.xml 
- Just run below maven command to generate the image:
		>> mvn spring-boot:build-image -DskipTests
- You can now create containers from the image:
		>> docker run --name expensemate-backend-instance -d -e MONGODB_URI=mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/expensemate -e OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23likzQSOkVxLoF9Ql -e OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=2a2e11ce9b9a3da23a690222879acaab3e01b034 -p 8080:8080 r15priyanshu/expensemate

============================ STEPS FOR CREATING DOCKER IMAGE USING GOOGLE JIB AND RUN CONTAINER
- Change packaging of the application to .jar in pom.xml
- Add Google Jib Maven Plugin and add image/tag name etc in pom.xml 
- Just run below maven command to generate the image:
		>> mvn compile jib:dockerBuild -DskipTests
- You can now create containers from the image:
		>> docker run --name expensemate-backend-instance -d -e MONGODB_URI=mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/expensemate -e OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23likzQSOkVxLoF9Ql -e OAUTH2_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=2a2e11ce9b9a3da23a690222879acaab3e01b034 -p 8080:8080 r15priyanshu/expensemate
		
============================ STEPS FOR CREATING DOCKER IMAGE USING DOCKER COMPOSE AND RUN CONTAINER
- Change packaging of the application to .jar in pom.xml
- Change final jar  name of the application in build in pom.xml
- Create docker file without any extension. 
- create docker-compose.yml file and configure it to use the Dockerfile created in previous step to create/build image.
- Here in docker-compose.yml file itself , you can configure image name,port mappings, environment variables,etc that you had to add while using docker run command.
- Run below command to both build image and then run container - 	
	>> docker compose up --build ( This will look for Dockerfile to build image )
	
NOTE: 
It is not necessary that you have to use/create Dockerfile to create image.
You can create image using above methods ( buildpack,gib etc ).
And simply run >> docker compose up. 
It will now try to only fetch/use the already created image and not build it.
